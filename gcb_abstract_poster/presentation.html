<p>Sekwencje amyloidogenne zawierają <em>hot-spots</em>, krótkie sekwencje aminokwasów, które przyczyniają się do agregowania białek w zazwyczaj cytotoksyczne kompleksy <span class="cite">(Fändrich 2012)</span>.</p>

<p>Agregaty amyloid są przyczyną różnych zaburzeń (m.in. choroby Alzheimera, Creutzfelda-Jacoba). Mimo podobieństw w procesie agregacji, białka amyloidogenne różnią się znacząco pod względem długości i składu aminokwasowego <span class="cite">(Breydo and Uversky 2015)</span></p>
