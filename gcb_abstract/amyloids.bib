	abstract = {Analyses of amyloidogenic sequence fragments are essential in studies of neurodegenerative diseases. However, there is no one internet dataset that collects all the sequences that have been investigated for their amyloidogenicity. Therefore, we have created the AmyLoad website which collects the amyloidogenic sequences from all major sources. The website allows for filtration of the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them. Registered users can both personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database. To maintain database reliability, submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available to the public. Finally, we re-implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors, thus the AmyLoad website can be used as a sequence analysis tool. We encourage researchers working on amyloid proteins to contribute to our service.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The AmyLoad website is freely available at http://comprec-lin.iiar.pwr.edu.pl/amyload/.

	abstract = {Protein misfolding and aggregation are known to play a crucial role in a number of important human diseases (Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, prion, diabetes, cataracts, etc.) as well as in a multitude of physiological processes. Protein aggregation is a highly complex process resulting in a variety of aggregates with different structures and morphologies. Oligomeric protein aggregates (amyloid oligomers) are formed as both intermediates and final products of the aggregation process. They are believed to play an important role in many protein aggregation-related diseases, and many of them are highly cytotoxic. Due to their instability and structural heterogeneity, information about structure, mechanism of formation, and physiological effects of amyloid oligomers is sparse. This review attempts to summarize the existing information on the major properties of amyloid oligomers.},

	abstract = {The formation of amyloid aggregates upon protein misfolding is related to several devastating degenerative diseases. The propensities of different protein sequences to aggregate into amyloids, how they are enhanced by pathogenic mutations, the presence of aggregation hot spots stabilizing pathological interactions, the establishing of cross-amyloid interactions between co-aggregating proteins, all rely at the molecular level on the stability of the amyloid cross-beta structure. Our redesigned server, PASTA 2.0, provides a versatile platform where all of these different features can be easily predicted on a genomic scale given input sequences. The server provides other pieces of information, such as intrinsic disorder and secondary structure predictions, that complement the aggregation data. The PASTA 2.0 energy function evaluates the stability of putative cross-beta pairings between different sequence stretches. It was re-derived on a larger dataset of globular protein domains. The resulting algorithm was benchmarked on comprehensive peptide and protein test sets, leading to improved, state-of-the-art results with more amyloid forming regions correctly detected at high specificity. The PASTA 2.0 server can be accessed at http://protein.bio.unipd.it/pasta2/.},

Focusing primarily on the oligomeric states formed from Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, this review will make references to other polypeptide systems, highlighting common principles or sequence-specific differences. The covered topics include the structural properties and polymorphism of oligomers, the biophysical mechanism of peptide self-assembly and its role for pathogenicity in amyloid disease. Oligomer-dependent toxicity mechanisms will be explained along with recently emerging possibilities of interference.},
